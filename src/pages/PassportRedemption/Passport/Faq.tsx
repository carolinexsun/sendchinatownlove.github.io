        <Question>1. What is the Send Chinatown Love Food Crawl?</Question>
        For the <strong>month of September</strong>, Send Chinatown Love is
        hosting a food crawl in Manhattan’s Chinatown, highlighting 13
        incredible restaurants, bakeries, cafes and more throughout the
        neighborhood. Come with your friends and family to explore locally and
        savor all the incredible things Chinatown has to offer and earn rewards
        for shopping with our merchants!
        <Question>
          2. What is the purpose of the Send Chinatown Love Food Crawl?
        </Question>
        <BulletPoint>
          Chinatown was disproportionately impacted by the lack of tourism and
          foot traffic resulting from COVID-19. To sustain long-term growth for
          the businesses in Chinatown, we have planned a food crawl for the
          entire month of September to bring foot traffic back to the
          neighborhood.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          Unlike a traditional food crawl, we encourage you to participate at
          your own pace and on your own schedule throughout the month to better
          ensure everyone’s health and safety.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          Collect tickets as you visit our 13 vendors around Chinatown and
          record them in your <em>Passport to Chinatown</em>. Your tickets will
          unlock rewards at local businesses in the neighborhood! Visit all 13
          vendors for a chance to win a grand prize!
        </BulletPoint>
        <Question>
          3. What is the <em>Passport to Chinatown</em>?
        </Question>
        The <em>Passport to Chinatown</em> is a mobile site that will be your
        ultimate guide to the Send Chinatown Love Food Crawl. It will track
        which vendors you’ve visited and provide a full list of local rewards
        you can redeem once you’ve submitted your unique ticket codes.
        <Question>
          4. How can I access my <em>Passport to Chinatown</em>?
        </Question>
        <BulletPoint>
          Scan the QR code on your ticket to access your{' '}
          <em>Passport to Chinatown</em>. You will be prompted to submit your
          email address and your ticket code.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          You can then view all of your collected tickets by entering your email
          address in your <em>Passport</em>, then clicking “View My Tickets.”
        </BulletPoint>
        <Question>5. How do I get a ticket?</Question>
        Spend at least $5 at any one of our 13 participating vendors and you
        will be issued a ticket. Each ticket has a unique ticket code that
        cannot be replaced — don’t lose this!
        <Question>6. How many tickets do I get per purchase?</Question>
        <BulletPoint>
          You get one (1) ticket per purchase over $5. You must spend a minimum
          of $5 to get one (1) ticket, and are limited to one (1) ticket per
          transaction.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          You will not get multiple tickets for purchases over $5.
        </BulletPoint>
        <Question>7. What are the tickets for?</Question>
        The tickets are used to track the vendors you’ve visited. Be sure to
        submit your unique ticket code to your Passport to Chinatown. Once
        submitted, every three (3) tickets will unlock rewards from a list of
        our local rewards partners.
        <Question>8. How many tickets do I need to win a reward?</Question>
        <BulletPoint>
          You must submit a <strong>total of three (3) tickets</strong> to
          redeem your reward at one of our local reward partners. Each of your
          three (3) tickets must be obtained from three{' '}
          <strong>(3) different</strong> vendors. You will{' '}
          <strong>
            <em>not</em>
          </strong>{' '}
          be eligible if you submit multiple tickets from the same vendor.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          Every three (3) tickets qualifies you for one (1) local reward. You
          can get as many tickets as you want, as long as your three (3) tickets
          are from different vendors.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          For example, if you collect a second ticket from a Food Crawl vendor
          you’ve already visited, you can use this ticket in combination with
          two other different vendors to redeem another reward.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          You can only redeem your reward once you have{' '}
          <strong>entered your unique ticket code</strong> into your{' '}
          <em>Passport to Chinatown</em>.
        </BulletPoint>
        <Question>9. What is a “rewards partner,” and who are they?</Question>
        <BulletPoint>
          We have partnered with other local businesses to offer rewards to food
          crawl participants who have successfully collected three (3) tickets.

        <BulletPoint>
          <strong>PPE.</strong> Please bring and wear your mask at all times

          traffic in the area, but not at the expense of others’ safety. Your
          own personal hand sanitizer is recommended, but not required, as many
          businesses will already have hand sanitizer available for you.
        </BulletPoint>
        <BulletPoint>
          <strong>Cash.</strong> Remember to bring cash, since many businesses

          the Chinatown area.
